## How AI Assisted in Writing Javadocs and Test Documentation

Throughout the development process, I leveraged AI to enhance the documentation and structure of my Java project, particularly in writing **Javadoc comments**, **test cases**, and **commit messages**. The AI-assisted workflow helped streamline the process by ensuring consistency, clarity, and adherence to best practices.

### **Javadoc Enhancement**
I used AI to generate **concise yet descriptive Javadoc comments** for classes, methods, and test cases. AI helped structure the documentation by:
- **Ensuring uniform formatting** across all files.
- **Improving clarity** by summarizing method functionality in a succinct manner.
- **Adding missing details** such as parameter descriptions and expected behavior.
- **Enhancing readability** with properly wrapped lines and indentation.
